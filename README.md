# Jason Li - Personal Website

This is the first iteration of my personal website! [Check it out here.](https://lijason.me/)

Throughout the course of this project, I learned how to build a web application with Gatsby and Strapi as a headless CMS. My favorite part about the development process was using Framer Motion and custom React Hooks to handle all the animations on the page.
